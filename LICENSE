TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

The term "License" shall encompass the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution, specifically as defined in Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

"Licensor" refers to the copyright owner or the entity authorized by the copyright owner who grants the License.

"Legal Entity" denotes the combination of the acting entity and any other entities with which it controls or shares common control. In this definition, "control" refers to:

1. The ability, whether directly or indirectly, to influence the direction or management of the entity, whether through contractual arrangements or other means.

2. Ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares.

3. Beneficial ownership of such entity.

The terms "You" (or "Your") refer to either an individual or a Legal Entity that is utilizing the permissions granted by this License.

The term "Source" form indicates the preferred format for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

The term "Object" form refers to any form that arises from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, encompassing, but not limited to, compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

The term "Work" denotes the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License. This is indicated by a copyright notice included in or attached to the work.

"Derivative Works" refers to any work in Source or Object form created based on (or derived from) the original work. These Derivative Works are characterized by editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications that collectively constitute an original work of authorship.

For the scope of this License, it is essential to note that Derivative Works do not encompass works that remain separate from the original work or merely connect (or bind by name) to the interfaces of the original Work and its Derivative Works.

The term "Contribution" encompasses any work of authorship, which includes the work's original version and any modifications or additions to that Work or its Derivative Works, intentionally provided to the Licensor for inclusion in the work. Such submission may be made by the copyright owner or an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

For this definition, "submitted" refers to electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives. This includes communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems managed by or on behalf of the Licensor to discuss and improve the work. However, it excludes communication explicitly marked or designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" refers to the Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on whose behalf the Licensor has received a Contribution and subsequently incorporated it within the work.

2. Limited Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each Contributor grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license. This license allows you to only reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and any such Derivative Works in both Source and Object form.

3. Conditional Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each Contributor grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license. This license permits You to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work. However, please note that this patent license applies only to those patent claims that can be licensed by the Contributor and are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or in combination with the Work to which their Contribution(s) was submitted.

It is essential to be aware that if You initiate patent litigation against any entity, including filing a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit, alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes a direct or

contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this license for that specific Work shall automatically terminate as of the date when such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.

You are permitted to reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or any Derivative Works, with or without modifications, in any medium, under the condition that you fulfil the following conditions:

a. You must provide any other Work or Derivative Works recipients with a copy of this license without any changes whatsoever.

b. If you modify any files, you must ensure that the modified files carry prominent notices stating that you have made changes to them.

c. When distributing Derivative Works in Source form, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work.

d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works you distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within that NOTICE file. You can place these notices in one of the following locations:

o Within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works.

o Within the Source form or documentation, if provided alongside the Derivative Works.

o Within a display generated by the Derivative Works, wherever third-party notices typically appear.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the license. However, you may add your attribution notices within Derivative Works that you distribute alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the original Work, as long as these additional attribution notices do not alter the terms of the license.

e. You have the freedom to add your copyright statement to your modifications and provide additional or different license terms and conditions for the use, reproduction, or distribution of your modifications or any such Derivative Works. However, your usage, reproduction, and distribution of the Work must otherwise comply with the conditions stated in this license and should not be contrary to any of the terms stated herein.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted by you for inclusion in the Work to the Licensor shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this license without any additional terms or conditions.

However, it is essential to note that the above terms do not override or alter the terms of any separate license agreement you may have previously executed with the Licensor concerning such Contributions. The terms of the separate license agreement shall remain in effect for those specific Contributions and will not be affected by this license.

6. Trademarks.

Under this license, you are not granted permission to use the Licensor's trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names except when necessary for limited, reasonable and customary use in describing the Work's origin and reproducing the NOTICE file's content. In such cases, you may use the relevant trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names to appropriately attribute the Work's origin and acknowledge the NOTICE file's contents.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides their Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, without any warranties or conditions, whether express or implied. This includes but is not limited to, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is essential to understand that you are solely responsible for assessing the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work. By exercising the permissions granted under this license, you assume any risks, without any exceptions, associated with such use or redistribution. The Licensor and Contributors do not provide any warranties or guarantees regarding the performance, suitability, or specific outcomes of using the Work under this license.

8. Limitation of Liability.

Under no circumstances and no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages. These damages include but are not limited to, any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any nature arising from this license or resulting from the use or inability to use the Work.

Such damages may include loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any other commercial damages or losses. Even if a Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages, they shall not be held liable for any adverse consequences arising from the use or inability to use the Work under this license. In any event, a contributors liability shall not exceed 1 USD, under any circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of the nature of claims.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works, you can offer and charge a fee for accepting support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with the terms of this license. If you accept such obligations, you must do so only on your behalf and take sole responsibility. You cannot act on behalf of any other Contributor.

In case you decide to accept any warranty or additional liability obligations, you must agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless from any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, that Contributor due to your acceptance of such warranty or additional liability. This means that you take full responsibility for any consequences or claims arising from the obligations you choose to accept, and you agree to protect the Contributors from any potential legal liabilities resulting from your actions.
